    bodyPara("The multi-agent system's 29% ABORT_STRATEGY rate should be interpreted as a tunable safety margin, not a ceiling. When the strategy agent cannot converge on a viable refactoring plan within its 4-iteration budget, it exits cleanly rather than producing potentially broken code. This is fundamentally different from Single's NO_CHANGE exits (2.5%), where the model silently returns unchanged code without indicating that no transformation was attempted."),
    bodyPara("The strategy agent's abort rate is tunable via: increasing the iteration budget, improving convergence heuristics, or relaxing plan-acceptance criteria. These are implementation-level optimizations, not architectural limitations. At the same time, the current conservative threshold ensures high precision on outputs that do get produced."),

    subHeading("4.3 Intent-Specific Strengths"),
    bodyPara("The multi-agent architecture shows clear advantages on well-scoped, procedural transformations (INLINE_METHOD, CONSOLIDATE_CONDITIONAL, EXTRACT_CONSTANT) where the strategy\u2013syntax decomposition maps naturally to the task structure. Single retains an edge on control-flow-heavy transformations (DECOMPOSE_CONDITIONAL, FLATTEN_CONDITIONAL, SPLIT_LOOP) that require holistic code understanding."),

    subHeading("4.4 Cost\u2013Quality Tradeoffs"),

On behavioral equivalence, the most important quality metric, the smaller models win. On compilation reliability, the gap is addressable through strategy-agent tuning. For cost-sensitive deployments where a moderate CSR reduction is acceptable in exchange for equivalent or superior behavioral quality, the multi-agent approach is already viable."),
